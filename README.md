# SETools - Maya (v4.1.0) (DEPRECATED)

---

# About this Fork

This is a Fork of the original SETools project, which fixes the "required argument is not an integer" error when exporting SEModel files in Maya 2022.

Original project link: [SETools - Maya](https://github.com/dtzxporter/SETools).

# NOTICE: SEAnims/SEModels are now DEPRECATED. Cast is the newly supported model and animation format.

- Convert SEModels to Cast Losslessly [SECast](https://dtzxporter.com/tools/secast)
- Get cast plugins [Cast](https://github.com/dtzxporter/cast)
- "My Tool Doesn't Support Cast" - BEG THE DEVELOPER, CAST IS MUCH EASIER TO EXPORT! Or use the converter.

A .SE format import / export plugin for Maya (2014+)

(Maya 2012 works, however some animations have interpolation bugs due to an unfixed Maya bug)

*.SE formats are open-sourced formats optimized for next-generation modeling and animation. They are free to be used in any project, game, software, etc with the hopes that people will adapt the standard unlike other formats available.*

- Animation format documentation: [Specification](https://github.com/SE2Dev/SEAnim-Docs)
- Model format documentation: [Coming soon](#)

## Installation:

Download the latest [seanim.py](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dtzxporter/SETools/master/seanim.py), [semodel.py](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dtzxporter/SETools/master/semodel.py) and [SEToolsPlugin.py](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dtzxporter/SETools/master/SEToolsPlugin.py) from the repo and save them in the following directory depending on your OS and Maya version:
- 32bit Windows: C:\Program Files(x86)\AutoDesk\Maya-ver\bin\plug-ins\
- 64bit Windows: C:\Program Files\AutoDesk\Maya-ver\bin\plug-ins\

Next, you must open the plugin manager using `Window->Settings/Preferences->Plugin Manager` once there find `SEToolsPlugin.py` and check off the following:
- Loaded (Loads the plugin)
- Auto load (Loads the plugin every launch)

## Updating:

Replace the files in the correct directory from the installation section with the new ones AND delete all of the `.pyc` files. Go to "SE Tools->Reload" Plugin to finish. If an error occurs, you must simply reload Maya.

## Usage:

*Animations:*
- To import an anim use "SE Tools -> Import SEAnim File" or drag and drop a file, this will import an anim onto an already binded scene.
- To export, either select the bones to use (or select none for all), set the end scene time to the animation end time, then use "SE Tools -> Export SEAnim File" this will export the animation to a .seanim file.
- To place a notetrack use "SE Tools -> Edit Notetracks" this will open a menu for editing notetracks and removing them.

*Models:*
- To import a model use "SE Tools -> Import SEModel File" or drag and drop a file, this will import a binded model with it's materials.
- To export, either select the bones / meshes to use (or select none for all), then use "SE Tools -> Export SEModel File" this will export the model to a .semodel file.
